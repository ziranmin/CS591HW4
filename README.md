To get output of constrained_results.txt, please run constrained_test.ipynb on Jupyter Notebook. Code constrained_train.ipynb is the file for me to compare Perceptron and Logistic Regression and get validation results.

To get output of unconstrained_results.txt, please run unconstrained_test.ipynb on Jupyter Notebook. Code unconstrained_train.ipynb is the file for me to find best parameter for CRF and compute validation results.

To evaluate output results, please enter "python conlleval.py constrained_results.txt" or "python conlleval.py unconstrained_results.txt" on command line/terminal.

You can go to my github https://github.com/ziranmin/CS591HW4, to have a better look of my code files and writeup.
